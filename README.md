# 🍈 Guava Disease Detector AI

An end-to-end Explainable AI (XAI) web application developed to classify guava fruit diseases using deep learning, built with **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow**, and **OpenCV**.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Guava Verification (Image Validation)**: Uses a pre-trained ImageNet model to verify that the uploaded file contains a guava fruit before running the disease classification model, preventing incorrect predictions for arbitrary uploads (e.g. cars, cats, other fruits).
2. **AI Disease Classification**: Predicts guava fruit condition into one of 3 categories:
   - **Healthy**
   - **Anthracnose**
   - **Fruit Fly**
3. **Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)**: Generates and overlays activation heatmaps to show the exact regions of the guava fruit that the model paid attention to during inference.
4. **Model Performance Dashboard**: Interactive visual comparisons of the four training strategies (Baseline, Weighted Loss, Oversampling, and Combination) utilizing Plotly charts and training history curves.
5. **Disease Encyclopedia**: Informative section detailing characteristics, symptoms, causes, and recommendations/preventions for each guava condition with image galleries.

## 🧠 Model Architecture & Experiments

The classification engine is based on **MobileNetV2** (with pre-trained ImageNet weights). We evaluated 4 distinct training configurations to handle class imbalance:

| Model Scenario | Test Accuracy | Loss | Macro F1-Score | Healthy Class F1-Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | 95.55% | 0.1353 | 95.40% | 95.19% |
| **Weighted Loss** | 94.76% | 0.1648 | 94.79% | 95.65% |
| **Oversampling** | 95.55% | 0.1382 | 95.48% | 95.65% |
| **Combination (Oversampling + Weighted)** | **95.81%** | **0.1127** | **95.77%** | **96.26%** |

*The **Combination (Oversampling + Weighted Loss)** model achieved the highest score and is deployed for live inference.*
